description: Air Pollution is a huge problem today, especially in metro cities. Prediction of air pollution can help people plan ahead. Also, governing bodies can form policies to mitigate the risks of air pollution. In this project, I aimed to develop a forecasting model for air pollution levels (PM 2.5 concentrations). I worked on this project under the supervision of Prof. at IIT Delhi.
