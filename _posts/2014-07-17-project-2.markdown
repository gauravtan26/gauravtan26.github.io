description: This project aimed to develop an end-to-end system for information retrieval from large volumes of texts. Originally the data was in the form of scanned images hence, implemented OCR using Python libraries to extract text from PDFs. I also developed a semantic search algorithm to facilitate the querying of text. I worked in a team of four people, all professional data scientists.
