description: Customers write a lot about products and services on social media. Extracting information from their reviews can help any business in developing its products. In this project, I took an active lead in developing a model to gain insights from customer reviews. I used state-of-the-art models for topic modeling (an unsupervised Natural Language Processing Technique) and created an interactive dashboard for the visualization of topics. In the entire course of this project, I worked with teams based in the United Kingdom and India.
