description: This project aimed to develop an end-to-end system for information retrieval from large volumes of texts. Originally the data was in the form of scanned images hence, implemented OCR using Python libraries to extract text from PDFs. To query the text, I developed a semantic search algorithm using similarity metrics on tokens. I worked in a team of four people, all of them professional data scientists.
